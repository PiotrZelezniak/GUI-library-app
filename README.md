# GUI-library-app
I have a lot of books so i often borrow it to my friends. Thats why i've created standalone application where i can storage all data about my borrowed books. In this application i can put some record like: 
-title of borrowed books
-Year of production
-Author
-ISBN
-Who borrowed this book
-Day of return book to me
-It also automatic pass the day when i borrow book to somebody

So what can I do with this record?
I can add new records, update them, search for specific records and also delete any record. 
Here i have both files for frontend and backend but also i share standalone aplication(.exe file) so everybody can use it.
